### Lab05: Activity Diagram
> In this lab, We have first defined the sprint goals and planned the sprint according to the time bound, LOC and complexity. The average time period to complete the sprint is expected to be of 2-3 weeks. This is required to mention that we have decided the Agile model for our project as this software engineering model reduces the risk associated with complexities, and the model works in iterative fashion.

> Sprints:
* Login/Register
* Table
* Restaurant Menu
* Cart
* Payment
* Feedback

> In the next task we have created the activity diagram according to the flow of the activities and tasks decided earlier.
